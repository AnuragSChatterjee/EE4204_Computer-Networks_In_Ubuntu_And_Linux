# EE4204_Computer-Networks_In_Ubuntu_And_Linux
A computer networks module that I took as an undergraduate at the National University Of Singapore (NUS). Did my lab assignment on fixed and varying batch size messaging transfer protocols in UDP using C and Socket Programming. 

My codes for fixed and varying batch size protocols as attached above develops a UDP-based client-server socket program for transferring a large message using a varying-batch-size protocol. Here, the message transmitted from the client to server is read from a large file. The message is split into short data-units (DUs) which are sent and acknowledged in batches of size 1, 2, and 3 DUs. The sender sends one DU, waits for an acknowledgment (ACK); sends two DUs, waits for an ACK; sends three DUs, waits for an ACK; and repeats the above procedure until the entire file is sent. The receiver sends an ACK after receiving a DU; sends next ACK after receiving two DUs; sends next ACK after receiving three DUs; and repeats the above procedure. I compared the message transfer time and throughput received for the sent and received files for various sizes of data-units and compared it with the fixed-batch-size protocol where the batch size is always fixed to be 2, i.e. the ACK is sent for every two DUs.
